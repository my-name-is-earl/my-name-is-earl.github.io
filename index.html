        Average Bookmarks! - <small>There are many link lists but this one is mine.</small>
      </h1>
      <h2 class="subtitle">
       There may have been a reason I felt these links worthy of another look, that reason has long since been forgotten. This is a rather dull and overly long list of average links. Looking now I am not sure why I bothered to make a list. It's posible I bookmarked these links to look busy after hitting the hide button on a screenful of unusual porn at work. Regardless of the true origin I can tell you this, I am certain this is not an awesome list. It's not even a special one, you will find no gems of information. Your time will not be well spent. There are no highlights on this list, nothing carefully researched, you will not find anything new or interesting. This is a an average list of bookmarks.
